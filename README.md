## About the app

The app shows california beaches. It uses a top naviation bar with some menus and enquiry button. 
The image gallery below shows recommended places with filtering tabs and search bar. 
You can see the geographical area, name and description of the beach. 
You can see the images of the beach in a image gallery with options to play, pause, next, previous, and fullscreen viewer. 
You can also see the services available at the beach with tooltip when you hover over it, such as parking, dog-friendly, wheelchair access, fishing etc. You can also click/tap on the phone number to
call the authorities to get more info. 
Scroll down to see the visitors reviews 
Footer with copyright marker with quick links 
and the scroll to top button to quickly scroll to the top.

## Final thoughts

The app could have been better if we had a UX/CX developer to help with the designs. 
But please let me know if you have any feedbacks where we can improve the app, if any. 
Thanks :)
